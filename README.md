# UNWSP-Python-Week-9

Program #1: Item Counter
 Assume a file containing a series of names (as strings) is named names.txt and exists on the computer's disk.  Write a program that displays the number of names that are stored in the file.

Program #2: Random Number File Writer
Write a program that writes a series of random numbers (up to 1000) to a file.  Each random number should be in the range of 1 through 500.  The application should let the user specify how many random numbers the file will hold (up to 1000).  

Program #3: Average Numbers

It should handle any IOError exceptions that are raised.
It should handle any ValueError exceptions that are raised when the items that are read from the file are converted to a number.
