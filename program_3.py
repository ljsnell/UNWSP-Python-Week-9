# Program #3: Average Numbers
# Assume a file containing a series of integers is named numbers.txt and exists on the computer's disk.
# (please use the provided numbers.txt)
# Write a program that reads all of the numbers stored in the file and calculates their total.  

# The program should handle the following exceptions: 

# It should handle any IOError exceptions that are raised.
# It should handle any ValueError exceptions that are raised when the items that are read from the file 
# are converted to a number.
